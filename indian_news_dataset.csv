733,"LiveMadharaasi & Ghaati: Live UpdatesTheatres across South India turned into a carnival on September 5 as Madharaasi and Ghaati arrived together, setting the stage for one of the most exciting box office clashes of the year. Fans of Sivakarthikeyan and Anushka Shetty poured in with drums, banners, and sheer energy, proving once again that cinema here is more than just entertainment — it’s a celebration.In Madharaasi, A. R. Murugadoss throws Sivakarthikeyan into a world of fire and grit. He’s Raghu, an ordinary man who wants nothing more than a simple life with his beloved Malathy, played by Rukmini Vasanth. But peace never lasts long in Murugadoss’ world. When Malathy becomes a pawn in a dangerous gun-smuggling game, Raghu is forced to confront ruthless criminals like Vidyut Jammwal and Biju Menon. What follows is a ride packed with action, heartbreak, and the courage of a man who never asked to be a hero, but rises because love leaves him no choice.Across theatres, Ghaati unravels a darker tale. Directed by Krish Jagarlamudi, it follows Desi Raju, played by Vikram Prabhu, a man broken by betrayal and pushed into crime. Alongside him, Anushka Shetty’s Sheelavathi holds her own with commanding screen presence, while Jagapathi Babu adds weight with his menacing flair. It’s a story that aches, showing how victims can be molded into legends when life gives them no escape.Two films, two worlds — one about a man dragged into a storm, another about a man who becomes the storm. Together, they’ve made September 5 a date to remember for cinema lovers.",2025-09-07,Entertainment,The Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/madharaasi-ghaati-movie-review-release-live-update-anushka-shetty-vikram-prabhu-sivakarthikeyan-rukmini-vasanth-vidyut-jammwal-madharaasi-ghaati-review-and-box-office-collection/liveblog/123709321.cms
